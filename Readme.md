React Native Flexbox Playground
====
Unique to React native:
* all containers in React Native are flex containers by default.
* properties are written in camelCase in CSS in JS
* In React Native, by default, the Main Axis is vertical while the Cross Axis is horizontal.
 * By default, every element in React Native has the flexDirection: column declaration.
* there are no percent-based styling in React Native.
* On the web, flex specifies how a flex item grows or shrinks to manage the space around it (along the main axis). In React Native, flex is generally used with flex items that are on the same level, but hold different flex values.
* React Native applies the following defaults:   
  `box-sizing: border-box;`   
  `position: relative;`   
  `align-items: stretch;`   
  `flex-shrink: 0;`   
  `align-content: flex-start;`   
  `border: 0 solid black;`   
  `margin: 0;`   
  `padding: 0;`   
  `min-width: 0;`
